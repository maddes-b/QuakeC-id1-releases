== Content of Repository

{url-qip-repo-qc}[This repository] contains all QuakeC code releases by {url-id}[id Software] for the {url-wikipedia-quake1}[Quake 1] main game logic, plus code releases for the official mission packs from other companies.

The code bases are available as-is in "original" branches with no bug-fixes implemented and (nearly) no clean-ups, only with aligned EOLs (LF) and trimmed leading white spaces.
Additional "cleanup" branches are available with aligned white spaces and code style, plus comments on known issues.
Last but not least "fixes" branches are available with known issues fixed, that do not break or alter game play.

Contributions are always welcome.


== What is QuakeC?

The game Quake 1 by id Software has its own coding language called QuakeC to define the game logic.
The original main game logic and resources are stored in a subfolder called 'id1'.

The releases of the QuakeC code allowed to fix the original game logic, modify it or even create your own independent game.
The game logic has to be compiled to create a byte-code program for the Quake 1 engine, which executes the game logic, renders the game to screen, does all the network traffic, etc.

Additionally re-licensing v1.05 beta and v1.06 to GPLv2 assuming to follow id's intention and reducing delta.
