== Content of Repository

IMPORTANT: *Branches can be rebased at any time! (=changed history).* +
Make yourself familar with `git pull --rebase`, `git reset --hard` and `git merge` with different remotes. +
See the {url-git-pro-rebase}[ProGit book], the {url-git-rebase-io}[git rebase in depth homepage] and the {url-git-docs-rebase}[command line docs].

{url-qip-repo-qc}[This repository] contains all QuakeC code releases by {url-id}[id Software] for the {url-wikipedia-quake1}[Quake 1] main game logic, plus code releases for the official mission packs from other companies.

The code bases are available in the "original" branches in a link:id1-CHANGELOG-cleanup.adoc[cleaned up manner] with no bug-fixes implemented.
Additional "fixes" branches are available with comments on known issues, and with known issues fixed, that do not break or alter game play.

Contributions are always welcome.


== What is QuakeC?

The game Quake 1 by id Software has its own coding language called QuakeC to define the game logic.
The original main game logic and resources are stored in a subfolder called 'id1'.

The releases of the QuakeC code allowed to fix the original game logic, modify it or even create your own independent game.
The game logic has to be compiled to create a byte-code program for the Quake 1 engine, which executes the game logic, renders the game to screen, does all the network traffic, etc.


== id1 (main game)

The game logic of the original game. The "id1-original" branch just shows the original history of the Quake 1 main game logic. +
Additionally re-licensing v1.05 beta and v1.06 to GPLv2 assuming to follow id's intention and reducing delta.
